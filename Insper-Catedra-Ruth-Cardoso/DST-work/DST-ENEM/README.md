## Daylight Saving Time (DST) & Exam Performance (Brazil)

This folder stores the code for my working paper on the **end of Daylight Saving Time (DST) in Brazil** and its effects on performance in **high-stakes exams (e.g., ENEM)**.

**Whatâ€™s here**
- Data prep and merging scripts
- Identification & estimation (DiD / event-study)
- Robustness checks and plotting

**Data access**
To keep the repository lean and compliant, **data are not included**.  
The code assumes external data files; point the scripts to your local paths (see comments at the top of the data script).

**Quick start**
1. Point paths in the data script to your local copies (or enable the synthetic run).
2. Run the estimation script to reproduce main figures/tables.

**Status**
Ongoing work; APIs and outputs may change as the paper evolves.
